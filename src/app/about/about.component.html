                    <p class="lead text-dark">Welcome to Jai Exports India</p>
                    <p>At Jai Exports India, we believe that everyday choices can lead to a cleaner, greener planet.
                        That’s why we’re dedicated to providing high-quality Bagasse plates — made from sugarcane
                        residue, a renewable and sustainable resource.</p>
                    <p>Our plates are 100% biodegradable, compostable, and completely free from plastic and harmful
                        chemicals. Whether you're hosting an event, running a food business, or simply seeking
                        eco-conscious alternatives, our products provide a safe, sturdy, and sustainable solution.</p>
                    <p>At Jai Exports India, we’re a purpose-driven team passionate about redefining everyday dining.
                        Using sugarcane bagasse — a renewable by-product of sugarcane processing — we craft premium
                        tableware that replaces plastic and conserves forests.</p>
                    <!-- <p>We exist to transform how people dine—merging innovation, elegance, and environmental stewardship. Join our mission: embrace sustainable dining and help us shape a cleaner planet, one plate at a time.</p> -->
